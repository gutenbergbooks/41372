<h2>WILLIS&#39;S CURRENT NOTES<br />
FOR THE MONTH.</h2>

<h2>NOTICE TO SUBSCRIBERS<br />
<span class="smcap">To the &quot;Price Current of Literature.&quot;</span></h2>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">G. Willis</span> gratefully acknowledges the various interesting
documents and letters he has received. He is anxious
that it should be perfectly understood that he is not the
author of any statement, representation, or opinion, that
may appear in his &quot;Current Notes,&quot; which are merely selections
from communications made to him in the course of
his business, and which appear to him to merit attention.
Every statement therefore is open to correction or discussion,
and the writers of the several paragraphs should be
considered as alone responsible for their assertions. Although
many notes have hitherto appeared anonymously,
or with initial letters, yet wherever a serious contradiction
is involved, G. Willis trusts that his Correspondents will
feel the necessity of allowing him to make use of their
names when properly required.</p>

<hr />

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">Ethnology.</span>&mdash;The marvellous pamphlet published in
New York, with reference to the Aztec Children exhibiting
there, has reached G. W., with the copy to be presented
to a distinguished traveller, which has been
delivered to him; and he seems not inclined to disbelieve
in the accuracy of any of its statements, whatever may
be the opinion of G. W.&#39;s New York Special Reporter.
(See &quot;Current Notes&quot; for January, p. 4.)</p>

<p class="indent">The pamphlet purposes to give an account of the discovery
of an idolatrous city called <i>Iximaya</i>, in Central
America, with 85,000 inhabitants, situate somewhere
about 16° 42&#39; N. and 91° 35&#39; W., whose priests seem to
consider the flesh of Scotchmen to be a peculiar culinary
luxury&mdash;when they can catch them. The information
given to the discoverers of the ideal or real city of
<i>Iximaya</i>, was &quot;that a man of the same race as Senor
Hammond, who was of a bright-florid complexion, with
light hair and red whiskers, had been sacrificed and eaten
by the Macbenachs or priests of Iximaya, the great
city among the hills, about thirty moons ago, (previous
to May, 1849).&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">It has been asserted that Mr. Wheelwright, an
American gentleman of the highest respectability, well
known and much respected both in London and Liverpool
as the originator of the Pacific Steam Navigation
Company, is (or was) well acquainted with the author of this
very extraordinary pamphlet. And although it must be
confessed, that if considered as a piece of mere invention,
for in marvellous incident it is a formidable rival to
the voyage and travels of one Lemuel Gulliver, or the
life and adventures of the well known Mr. Robinson
Crusoe,&mdash;yet the fact should not be forgotten, that
&quot;Truth is sometimes stranger than fiction.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">G. W. anxiously looks for the opinions of the well-informed
press upon this matter, which, with the exception
of the <i>Sunday Times</i> of the 15th of February, have
been silent about the &quot;Pigmies&quot; exhibiting in New
York;&mdash;and about which, as G. W.&#39;s &quot;Special&quot; observed
last month&mdash;&quot;there is <span class="smcap">NO MISTAKE</span>.&quot;</p>

<hr />

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">The Bawdrick or Baldrock</span>, (<i>Illustrated Correction</i>.)&mdash;Few
people feel inclined to acknowledge an
error, or to make a correction. See Willis&#39;s &quot;Current
Notes&quot; for February last (p. 16), where Sir Walter
Scott&#39;s remark is quoted, that &quot;it is ill making holes
in one&#39;s own stockings for the purpose of darning them
again, darn we never so neatly.&quot; However, G. W. is
always happy&mdash;not to feel himself in the wrong&mdash;but
to correct any mistake which inadvertently he or his
agents may have made. He has therefore no hesitation
about printing the following communication.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;H. T. E. informs G. W. that the engraver of the
sketch of the Bawdrick, which appeared in the last
number of the &quot;Current Notes&quot; (p. 5), has omitted
one important reference, and a letter of reference, (which
H. T. E. believes he sent).</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 84px;">
<img src="images/fig001-600dpi.png" width="84" height="300" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p class="indent">&quot;In fig. 2, letter B, all is right.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But in fig. 1, letter B is wrong; it should have been
by the side, and where that B is should have been an
E, which was thus described:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;E. A piece of hard wood, placed between the staple
and the end of the clapper, which is made steady to the
clapper by D, the busk board, &amp;c.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;As engraved, H. T. E. fears it will be a terrible
puzzler to the uninitiated in Campanology, and even
Campanologists will wonder at the confusion.
The upper joint should have been <i>thus</i>, and the
lower joint square (but G. W.&#39;s artist has reversed
the thing), for it is at B that the clapper
swings.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Still it is well to have got the thing shewn to
the public, and H. T. E. thanks G. W., and
supposes all blunders must be set down to his
correspondent&#39;s fault of indistinct writing.&quot;</p>

<hr />

<p class="right">Strood, Rochester, 13th Feb. 1852.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">Sir,</span>&mdash;In reference to the letter of H. T. E. page 5 of

<h2><span class="smcap">The Historic Society of Lancashire and
Cheshire.</span></h2>

<p class="right">Liverpool, 30th Jan. 1852.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">Sir,</span>&mdash;I have to complain that your Correspondent
T. M. rushes into print so incautiously on the subject of
his tobacco-pipe. From the accuracy of his quotation,
he appears to have had the Society&#39;s volume before him,
yet he has taken no trouble to arrive at the truth. Mr.
Lamb&#39;s paper was read three months before the woodcut
of the pipe in question appeared; but as the latter
was of peculiar form, it was engraved, as well as one or
two others that had not been exhibited. All of these
were minutely referred to. Thus, in the <span class="smcap">Note respecting
the Plates</span>, p. iii. there is the following:&mdash;&quot;No.
14 [on Plate IV.] is from &#39;Willis&#39;s Current Notes,&#39;
for April, 1851; the stem is of bamboo, and the top of
the bowl of brass. It was found in taking down an old
inn at Fulham in 1836.&quot; From a mutilated copy I
send you the actual leaf for the use of T. M.;<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> and have
to express my sorrow that he does not possess either more
patience or more civility,</p>

<h2><span class="smcap">The late J. M. W. Turner, R.A.</span></h2>

<p class="indent"><i>G. W. has the honour to acknowledge the receipt of
five communications respecting the Sketch of the late
Mr. Turner, which appeared with</i> J. T. A.&#39;s <i>letter in
the January number of</i> &quot;Current Notes,&quot; (p. 1.) <i>Four
of his correspondents are pleased with the Sketch, and
one who signs himself</i>, D. R. <i>states that he knew Mr.
Turner well, and considers it to be, &quot;no caricature,
but on the contrary, an excellent likeness</i>.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><i>However, the following epistle, expresses a different
opinion.</i></p>

<p class="right">Yarm<sup>o</sup>. Feb, 2, 1852.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">Sir,</span>&mdash;How very vexing it is that the &quot;rude sketch&quot;
favoured by your obliging correspondent, (J. T. A.) was not
placed in the hands of some R. A. (before engraved), who
was acquainted and well knew that celebrated painter, and
from that (&quot;rude sketch&quot;) and the knowledge he (R. A.)
had of the late Turner, would have favoured us with a more
characteristic portrait. Was he not more than four feet in
stature? This represented (&quot;Current Notes,&quot; January,
1852, p. 1), reminds us of a wooden punchinello more than
any thing that ever breathed, and not at all <i>credible</i> to the
&quot;Current Notes.&quot; All such Notes are highly interesting
if properly done.</p>

<p class="indent">In haste. <span class="ralign">Yours faithfully,<br />
W.</span></p>

<hr />

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">The Marquis of Worcester</span>, (<i>Author of the &quot;Century

his communication.</p>

<h2><span class="smcap">Ancient Signet explained.</span></h2>

<p class="right">Southwick, near Oundle,<br />
Jan. 30th, 1852.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">Sir,</span>&mdash;Your excellent little work, &quot;Current Notes,&quot;
is worthy of all praise and support; as affording to the
Numismatist, the Paleologist, and the Archeologist, &amp;c.
the means not only of giving a written account of their
various studies, but also of exhibiting facsimiles of the
objects of their research. At the same time that I
thank you for the insertion of my last (p. 3, Jan. 1852),
allow me to present you with one of, I think, much
greater interest to the Chronologist and Historian, taken
from &quot;Gesenii Monumenta Ph&oelig;nicia, Pars 3, Tab. 11,
fig. XL. bis,&quot;</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 247px;">
<img src="images/fig002-600dpi.png" width="247" height="300" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p class="indent">The letters at the top of the signet
are <i>Ch sr b l</i>; and the
reading is, &quot;<i>The great king</i>.&quot;
At the bottom of the signet they
are, <i>A ch m n</i>; and the reading
is, &quot;<i>Achemen</i>,&quot; and with
the Greek termination <i>Achæmenes</i>.
On the right side they
are <i>a n b</i>, Hebrew &#1488; &#1503; &#1489;, taken
as numerical characters, <i>i.e.</i>
1000, 700, 2; making the date
1702. On the left, the figure
like the Greek &#948;, is the sign of
Taurus, to denote the month when the sun entered into
Taurus. The <i>dove and leaf</i> seem to refer to &quot;<i>the dove
and olive leaf</i>,&quot; Gen. viii. 11.</p>

<p class="indent">Let me now refer your readers to Drummond&#39;s Origines,
v. 1, p. 310:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The Greeks fancied Achæmenes to have been the
name of the progenitor of Cyrus; but <i>Achæmenes</i> is
nothing else than a corruption of one of those pompous
and impious titles, which were assumed by the kings of
Iran, and of which the inscriptions explained by M. de
Sacy afford many examples. <i>Achæmenes</i>, as I have
shown elsewhere, signifies <i>Rex c&oelig;li</i> in ancient Persian.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">So much for <i>guess-work</i>, which cannot be too much
reprobated. I do not pretend to any skill in chronology,
but the calculation appears to be so simple, that I will
attempt it, taking the dates of our authorized version of
the Bible.</p>

<table border="0" cellpadding="1" cellspacing="0" width="80%" summary="dates">
<tr>
<td>Deluge</td>
<td>2349 <span class="smcap">A.C.</span></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Signet engraved</td>
<td>1702 <i>from</i> the Deluge</td>

<tr>
<td>Or</td>
<td>647 <span class="smcap">A.C.</span></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Cyrus begins to reign</td>
<td>537 <span class="smcap">A.C.</span></td>
</tr>
</table>

<p class="indent">Therefore, from the beginning of the reign of Achæmenes
to the same of Cyrus is 110 years.</p>

<p class="indent">From this remarkable signet we obtain the historical
truth, that Achæmenes began his reign in the month
Taurus, 1702, after <span class="smcap">THE</span> <i>Deluge</i>. I have found the
Deluge taken as an epoch in various Cuneiform and
Egyptian, &amp;c. documents, that have not been explained
to the public. <span class="ralign">Yours truly,</span></p>

<p class="right">No. 59, Grey Street, Newcastle, Tyne,<br />
January 28th, 1852.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">Sir,</span>&mdash;In your &quot;Current Notes&quot; for this month (p. 7),
a correspondent, A. K., enquires about &quot;Robert Hoblyn&quot;
and his Works. Presuming he has made a mistake
in the name, and that he means &quot;Richard&quot; instead
of &quot;Robert,&quot; I send herewith a list of some of
&quot;Richard&#39;s&quot; Works,</p>

<p class="right">I remain, yours,</p>

<p class="indent">Mr. Willis. <span class="ralign"><span class="smcap">Thomas Gray.</span></span></p>

<h2><span class="smcap">Robert Hoblyn.</span></h2>

<p class="right">4, Birchin Lane,<br />
February 7th, 1852.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">Sir,</span>&mdash;In answer to a letter in your &quot;Price Current&quot;
for January 25th, (p. 7), addressed to you, and signed
&quot;A. K.&quot; I beg to inform your correspondent that
&quot;Robert Hoblyn,&quot; published the following works:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="indent">&quot;Bibliotheca Hoblyniana,&quot; 8vo. London, 1767.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The First Book of the Georgics of Virgil, Lat. and
Eng. with Translation in blank verse, and notes,
8vo. London, 1825.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="indent">It is worthy to notice that &quot;M. A.&quot; is affixed to his
name in the last named work.</p>

<p class="indent">I am not aware that he published any other works;
but a perusal of the Catalogue of Printed Books in the
British Museum would satisfactorily decide this point.</p>

<p class="indent">Perhaps your correspondent means &quot;Richard Hoblyn,&quot;

<h2><span class="smcap">Lavers</span>, <i>the Bookseller</i>.</h2>

<p class="right">Overseal, Ashby de la Zouch.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">Sir,</span>&mdash;I should be very much obliged to any of your
correspondents who will give me information respecting
Mr. Lavers, a bookseller in London, who flourished about
the third quarter of the last century; especially any
thing relating to his wife and descendants.</p>

<p class="right">Very faithfully yours,<br />
<span class="smcap">J. M. Gresley.</span></p>

<p class="indent">13th Feb. a.d. 1852.</p>

<hr />

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">Tradesmen&#39;s Tokens.</span>&mdash;Can any of your readers inform
me if there are any Tradesmen&#39;s Tokens of Scotland,
issued during the 17th century; and if not, can any
cause be assigned for it. I have a very large collection
of tokens of the 17th century, of England, Wales, and
Ireland, but not one of Scotland, which is very singular,
as the towns of Edinburgh, Glasgow, Aberdeen, Sterling,
Perth, &amp;c. must have had as great need of a small
currency, as many small villages in England, of which
there are many specimens.</p>

<p class="indent">By far the most numerous of the English tokens
belong to the Southern and Midland districts: of the city
of Oxford alone I have 62 varieties. The Northern
Counties are much fewer in number: of Cumberland I
have only tokens of two towns, Carlisle and Cockermouth;
of Northumberland, the town of Newcastle only;
of Westmoreland, Appleby, Kendal, and Kirby Steven.</p>

<p class="indent">The ordinary value is the halfpenny for the Southern
Counties, having usually the Arms of some Company of
the City of London, and the initials of the issuer, his
wife and family name, with the name, trade and business
at full length. The great bulk of these tokens are of a
monotonous character, with a few curious exceptions.</p>

<p class="indent">One of square shape, issued by Thomas Dedicot, in
Bewdley, has the legend, &quot;<span class="smcap">Square Dealing</span>.&quot;
A copper token of Worcester, has a brass plug in the
centre. A facetious Boniface of Leeds gives us the
double-entendre, &quot;<span class="smcap">Beware the Beare</span>,&quot; with his
sign of the Bear. To make the catch better, it should
be known that in Yorkshire, <span class="smcap">Beer</span> and <span class="smcap">Bear</span>, are pronounced
alike. The device and motto of the Baron
Bradwardine is consequently older than the time of the
author of Waverley. Roger Dickinson, of Robin Hood&#39;s
Bay, affects a heart-shaped token, on which are represented
the popular heroes, Robin Hood and Little John:
Little John is represented half the size of Robin Hood,
instead of being considerably taller, not knowing he was
so nick-named from his gigantic stature. There are
other tokens of octagon and diamond shape.</p>

<p class="indent">The Welsh tokens are generally of very good execution:
the halfpenny of Edward Lloyd, of Kidwelly, is
very neat; a few of Carnarvon are small, and issued at
one penny, of a similar character to those of Ireland,
which I have next to mention.</p>

<p class="indent">The Irish tokens are of a different character to those
of England and Wales, being generally small, issued at
one penny, and the issuer styling himself Marchant.
The penny token of John Whittle, of Kilkenny, 1656, has
the Arms of the Commonwealth on it; the only instance
that I know of: the King&#39;s Arms are plentiful enough.</p>

<p class="indent">Besides the list of towns given by Lindsay in his
&quot;View of the Coinage of Ireland, 1839,&quot; I can add from

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">Lithography.</span>&mdash;Some years ago, letters and papers

<p class="indent">&quot;<i>This is the first impression of Ackermann&#39;s Lithographic

</blockquote>

<p class="indent">Combe was so intimately connected with Ackermann&#39;s
establishment, that there can be no doubt of the fact
that the paper I have, was truly the very <i>first</i> impression
in Lithography in England. The poetic scrap was
no doubt Combe&#39;s own, and the facsimile shews that it
was in Combe&#39;s writing.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">These</span> terms are now so frequently used in reference
to periods and works of art, that it would be useful to
your readers if some competent person would define precisely
what period is comprehended in the term <i>mediæval</i>.
In a recent Exhibition many works of a comparatively
late date were classed as mediæval. Mr. James, speaking
of <i>Charlemagne</i>, says&mdash;&quot;the precise birth-place of
the greatest man of the middle ages is unknown.&quot; Here
he refers to the year 742. Some of the correspondents
will, perhaps, through your &quot;Notes Current,&quot; define the

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">Sir,</span>&mdash;With regard to the inquiry made in your

Archæological publications, I wish to direct your Correspondent
to a publication issued by the Architectural

Bedfordshire, consisting of the Reports and Papers read
before those Societies in the year 1850. The second
part, comprising the Transactions for the Year 1851, is
now in the press, and will shortly be published. These
two parts will form one handsome octavo volume, printed
more especially for the use of the Members of the above
Societies, but a few copies are reserved for general sale,
for which Mr. Masters is the agent; Thinking that

of this volume, I thought it as well to trouble you with

<h2><span class="smcap">Scraps from the United States</span></h2>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">The</span> space at G. W.&#39;s command will only permit him
to notice generally, and most gratefully to acknowledge,
the number, variety, and interest of C. F. D.&#39;s communications,
and sincerely to thank him for the kind manner
in which they have been forwarded.</p>

<p class="indent">1. The existence of Hebrew relics among the Pottawatomie
Indians is extremely curious. That procured
by Dr. Lykins is described as consisting of</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="indent">&quot;Four small rolls or strips of parchment, closely packed
in the small compartments of a little box or locket, of about
an inch cubical content. On these parchments are written,
in a style of unsurpassed excellence, and far more beautiful
than print, portions of the Pentateuch, to be worn as frontlets,
and intended as stimulants to the memory and moral
sense.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="indent">2. A notice of Professor Stuart&#39;s death has been
recorded in G. W.&#39;s Literary and Scientific Obituary.</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="indent">&quot;He published at least twenty-four volumes, and in addition
to them many single sermons and newspaper essays, and
contributed more than two thousand octavo pages to American
periodicals. His commentaries are those on the Hebrews,
Romans, Revelation, Daniel, Ecclesiastes, and the
Proverbs. He printed his first Hebrew Grammar without
points, and <i>set up about half the paradigms of verbs with
his own hands</i>.&mdash;This grammar went through three editions,
each one being more full than the preceding.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="indent">3. The intelligence of the Spanish Press is highly
amusing.</p>

<p class="indent">4. The charge made against the Editor of the Oxford
Edition of Milton requires proof or explanation.</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="indent">&quot;Mr. Whittier states in the National Era, that the carefully
prepared Oxford edition of Milton&#39;s Works, contains
a poem by Elizabeth Lloyd, of Philadelphia, purporting to
have been written by the poet in his old age and blindness,
and which is so well executed, as to have deceived the English
editor of his works. This poem is now going the rounds
of the American press, as the production of Milton.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="indent">5. The appearance of the fifth and sixth volumes of
Lord Mahon&#39;s History of England has thus brought
forth the indignation of the editor of the Boston (U. S.)
&quot;Transcript.&quot;</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="indent">&quot;They commence at the year 1763, and close with the
year 1779, and comprise, of course, as the principal theme,
the American Revolution&mdash;the rise and progress of the War
of Independence. &#39;One point in the American War,&#39; says
the Spectator, &#39;Lord Mahon brings out quietly and impressively&mdash;the
personal falsehood of Franklin, and often
the brutality of the Americans at large.&#39; Here will be a
chance for our American reviewers and critics. &#39;The personal
falsehood of Franklin!&#39; It will take the affidavit of
more than one Lord to make that credible.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="indent">6. The old American bookseller, whose career was so
graphically described by Dr. Francis at the celebration
of the hundred and forty-sixth anniversary of Franklin&#39;s
birth-day, by the New York Typographical Society, was
the father of the present Editor of the Literary World,
an American periodical, extremely well conducted, and
of considerable circulation.</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="indent">
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page14" id="page14"></a>[pg&nbsp;14]</span>
&quot;There are many booksellers and publishers,&quot; observed
Dr. Francis, &quot;whose character and influence might justly
command detailed account. Spence himself would find
among them anecdotes of consideration in the world of letters,
I must, however, write within circumscribed limits.
The first in immediate recollection is Evert Duyckinck. He
was a middle-aged man when I was a boy occasionally at
his store, an ample and old-fashioned edifice, at the corner
of Pearl Street and Old Slip. He was grave in his demeanor,
and somewhat taciturn; of great simplicity in
dress, accommodating and courteous. He must have been
rich in literary occurrences. He for a long while occupied
this excellent stand for business, and was quite extensively
engaged as a publisher and seller. He was a sort of Mr.
Newbury, so precious to juvenile memory in the olden
times. He largely dealt with that order of books, for elementary
instruction, which were popular abroad, just about
the close of our revolutionary war and the adoption of our
Constitution, Old Dyche and his pupil Dilworth, Perry,
and Sheridan. As education and literature advanced, he
brought forward, by reprints, Johnson and Chesterfield,
and Vicesimus Knox, and a host of others. His store was
the nucleus of the Connecticut teachers&#39; intellectual products,
and Barlow and Webster, and Morse and Riggs,
found him a patron of their works in poetry and school
books. Bunyan, and Young, and Watts, Doddridge and
Baxter, must have been issued by his enterprise in innumerable
thousands throughout the whole thirteen States;
and the old English Primer, now improved into the American
Primer, with its captivating emendations, as</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The royal oak, it was the tree</span><br />
<span class="i0">That saved his Royal Majesty;</span><br />
</div>
</div>

<p class="indent">improved by the more simple diction,</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Oak&#39;s not as good</span><br />
<span class="i0">As hickory wood;</span><br />
</div>
</div>

<p class="indent">and the lines,</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Whales in the sea</span><br />
<span class="i0">God&#39;s voice obey;</span><br />
</div>
</div>

<p class="indent">now modified, without loss of its poetic fire,</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Great deeds were done&mdash;</span><br />
<span class="i0">By Washington&mdash;</span><br />
</div>
</div>

<p class="indent">led captivity captive, and were circulated without limits for
the better diffusion of knowledge and patriotism throughout
the land. As our city grew apace, and both instructors and
their functions enlarged, he engaged in the Latin Classics.
Having a little Latin about me, it became my duty to set
up at the printing-office of Lewis Nicols, Duyckinck&#39;s reprint,
De Bello Gallico. The edition was edited by a Mr.
Rudd. He was the first editor I ever saw; I looked at him
with school-boy admiration when I took him the proofs.
What alterations or improvements he ever made in the text
of Oudendorp, I never ascertained. This, however, must
have been among the beginnings of that American practice,
still so common among us, of deeming it necessary that the
reprints of even the most important works from abroad
should have, for better circulation, some name as editor inserted
on the title-page. Mr. Duyckinck was gifted with
great business talents, and estimated as a man of great
punctuality and rigid integrity in fiscal matters. He was
the first who had the entire Bible, in 12mo. preserved&mdash;set
up in forms&mdash;the better to supply, at all times, his patrons.
This was before stereotype plates were adopted. He gave
to the Harpers the first job of printing they ever executed&mdash;whether
&#39;Tom Thumb&#39; or &#39;Wesley&#39;s Primitive Physic,&#39; I
know not. The acorn has become the pride of the forest&mdash;the
Cliff Street Tree, whose roots and branches now ramify
over the land. Duyckinck faithfully carried out the proverbs
of Franklin, and the sayings of Noah Webster&#39;s
Prompter. He was by birth and by action a genuine
Knickerbocker.&quot;</p>

a branch of the Devonshire family. But in the valuable

there is a well-preserved MS. copy of &quot;The Life and
Death of Cardinal Wolsey,&quot; by Th. Gainsford. This interesting
MS. is a folio volume of 166 pages. It embraces
all that is contained in Cavendish&#39;s &quot;Life of

<p class="indent">&quot;The following is a History of this celebrated Print:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Faithorne, with his master, Robert Peake, engaged in
the King&#39;s service, and were both taken prisoners at Basing
House, from whence Faithorne was brought to London,
and confined in Aldersgate; here resuming his occupation,
he produced the exquisite Portrait of the Protector, (known
as Cromwell between the Pillars), which pleased the parties
then in power so much, that shortly after, it occasioned his
being set at liberty, and he retired to France. Copies of
the original print have been known to sell as high as
40 pounds!</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Mr. Caulfield in his Chalcographiana, says, Mr. Bull
the celebrated Collector, shewed him the original drawing
in red chalk from which Faithorne engraved the print; from
whom he also learned the face was afterwards altered to
William III.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Your Correspondent T. K.&#39;s notice of Queen Elizabeth&#39;s
ring, said to have been given to the Earl of
Essex, (&quot;Current Notes,&quot; for December last, p. 95),
reminds me of another ring, that
of Mary Queen of Scots, for using
which she was censured on her
Murder-trial, in consequence of
its having the Arms of England
impaled with those of Scotland.
I possess a <i>facsimile</i> of that
signet ring, procured from a seal
engraved in Edinburgh. I should
feel particularly obliged if any of
your Antiquarian friends can inform me, where the original
now is. I was told that it was in the British Museum,
and had inquiry made there, but to no purpose. I
rather think paste facsimiles may be had at Mr. Wilson&#39;s,
formerly Tassie&#39;s, in Leicester Square. Mine is
an engraving on Amethyst, and I shall seal this letter
with it.</p>

<p class="right">Respectfully yours,<br />
R. B.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">A Travelling Name.</span>&mdash;The anecdote told by your
Correspondent &quot;J.&quot; in the last number of your &quot;Current
Notes,&quot; p. 7, is somewhat differently related in the
Memoir of Mr. James Smith, prefixed to his &quot;Comic
Miscellanies,&quot; where it is stated: &quot;The following incident
occurred to James Smith in a Brighton coach. An
old lady struck with his extraordinary familiarity with
things and people, at length burst forth, &#39;And pray, Sir,
you who seem to know every body&mdash;pray may I ask who
you are?&#39; &#39;James Smith, Madam.&#39; This evidently
conveying nothing to her mind, a fellow passenger added,
&#39;One of the authors of the <i>Rejected Addresses</i>.&#39; The
old lady stared at them by turns, and then quietly said,
&#39;I never heard of the Gentleman or the book before.&#39;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">Sale of Rare Books.</span>&mdash;Some curious books of an
interesting character, collected by the son of <span class="smcap">Simon
Lord Lovat</span>, who, it will be remembered, was executed
for treasonable practices, have recently been sold by
Auction by Messrs. <span class="smcap">Sotheby &amp; Wilkinson</span>, of Wellington
Street. The Collection contained specimens from
the presses of Pynson, Wynkyn de Worde and Caxton;
also some rare and early works relating to America, and
on the subject of English Theology during the time of
the Elizabethan Age, and some curious works on
Machinery and the Occult Sciences. Among them may
be specially named, &quot;<span class="smcap">The Book of the Ordre of
Chyvalry or Knyghthode</span>,&quot; (lot 244), said to be one
of the rarest productions of the press of <span class="smcap">Caxton</span>; one
of three copies, (two of which being in the British
Museum), and considered to be one of the most interesting
volumes which we owe to the perseverance of Caxton
as a translator, and of great beauty as an example
of his typographic skill. It unfortunately wanted two
leaves, but produced £55. 10s. The next in importance
(lot 585) was a copy of the works of <span class="smcap">Ben Jonson</span>, the
edition of 1640, having belonged to the Somerset family,
and of much interest from the circumstance of its containing
on the inside of the cover an unpublished Poem
of twenty-six lines, of a complimentary character, on
the Nuptials of Robert Carr, Earl of Somerset, entirely
in the autograph of Ben Jonson, and concluding with the
following beautiful stanza:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&quot;And when your yeares rise more than would be told,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Yet neyther of you seeme to th&#39; other old.</span><br />
<span class="i0">That all y<sup>t</sup> view you then, and late may say,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Sure this glad payre were maried but this day.&quot;</span>
</div>
</div>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Ben Jonson.</span></p>

<p class="indent">The flattering wishes of the great Bard were however
not realized in the future history of the unhappy pair.
It produced £14, and has found a resting-place in the
British Museum.</p>
